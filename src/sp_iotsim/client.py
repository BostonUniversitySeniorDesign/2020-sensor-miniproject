"""
WebSockets client

This program receives simulated data for multiple rooms, with multiple sensors per room.

The default behavior is to only access the computer itself by parameter "localhost"
so that no firewall edits are needed.

The port number is arbitrary, as long as the server and client are on the same port all is well.

Naturally, the server must be started before this client attempts to connect.
